This is my two player game. 

    Game Description:
Each player tries to 'eat' their 'food' by moving their player icon over a circle with the same color as their player icon. If they hit the edges of the game their score resets to zero. Their player moves faster every time they eat some food, and so the game becomes harder. The first player to 100 points wins. 

    Game Controls:
Player1 controls are:
'w' = Up
'a' = Left
'd' = Right
's' = Down

Player2 controls are:
'i' = Up
'j' = Left
'l' = Right'
'k' = Down'
